# Simple Calculator

A simple, browser-based calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I created this project as a practice exercise to strengthen basic JavaScript skills, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing basic arithmetic logic.


## Description

This project is a functional calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It focuses on **JavaScript logic implementation** and handling **user input through the DOM**.  
The project demonstrates:

-   Parsing and evaluating simple arithmetic expressions.
-   Handling operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).
-   Implementing error handling for cases like division by zero.


## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/micned1111/calculator_proj1
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd calculator-project
3. Open **index.html** in your preferred web browser


## Tech Stack

* HTML – structure
* CSS – styling (very basic)
* JavaScript – logic and interactivity


# FYI (important)

I have not error-proofed this solutions 100%. 
Bugs are (most likely) to be expected.


## Future improvements

-   Add decimal support
-   Add keyboard support
-   Improve error-handling

-   Utilize regex instead of relying on if-tests
-   Replace the double-loop in **calculateExpression()** with either:
    - Functionality with eval()
    - Shunting-yard algorithm
